	<font>So. No Pointless game has been out in a while. A while back I tried making Pointless 3, however development went south. In the end I canceled it. <p></p>Now, I don't have any projects and decided to make a new Pointless game. This isn't any pointless game, however. This is a collection of all the Pointless games, and more will come soon. <p></p> Some notable inclusions are the Pointless 3 Beta builds, some new minigames such as Lava Jump, and a very cool addition in Pointless 1.<p></p>Currently this is in refinement, so this will more than likely be released on time.</font>

	<!-- Cell engine announcment -->
	<hfont>Introducing Cell</hfont>
	<p></p>
	<font>I thought it would be cool if I added some stuff to the Pointless Engine (Clarity), but after a while I decided to fork it. This means I can <p></p>add a bunch of stuff to the engine. Some of the planned features include teleportation, traps, gates, MAYBE enemy AI, and more. <p></p> The first game using this would be the Pointless 2 Remaster. So this should be cool.<p></p> Oct 7, 2020</font>

	<hfont>Pointless 2 Remaster</hfont>
	<p></p>
	<img src="img/p2r.svg" width="900px"></img>
	<p></p>
	<font>So. I guess this is the first major project after starting back up. It seems like Pointless 2 has been the most disliked in the series,<p></p> so I am hoping this remaster of it will bring interest. This is the only game that the code is actually somewhat decent, so this shouldn't take long.<p></p>I will make another post when its done i guess.</font>
