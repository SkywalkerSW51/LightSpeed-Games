Hello



This project was started by me after looking at old code from the LightSpeed Games project.

I decided to revive the site, because it ended abruptly. The project will now be known as the LightSpeed Revival Project.


Creating LightSpeed Games was a fun time, and I want to continue that. 


A few notable additions:


- Cleaned up code

- Added SPL v3 License

- "Remastered" some games

- Added Betas for games that never came out

- Added code from the Python Project






Thanks to everyone who played.
